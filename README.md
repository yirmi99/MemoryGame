in this memory game, I create a grid of cards (4x5) with 10 characters and for each character there are two cards. When a new game starts we make Ajax call which returns a response in a json structure to receive data for requested characters and then the selection for the characters is made randomly. 
In this game, at the end of each round, information is received for how long the game lasts by Ajax call to receive the staring and ending time of the game and calculate it.
In this code there are two Ajax calls for getting the staring and ending time of the game and in addition Ajax call for getting the data of the characters.
